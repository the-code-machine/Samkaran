Under computing, it includes all the services a computing device can offer to you along with the flexibility of a virtual environment. It also allows the user to configure their instances as per their requirements i.e. allocate the RAM, ROM, and storage according to the need of the current task. Even the user can dismantle the virtual device once its task is completed and it is no more required. For providing, all these scalable resources AWS charges some bill amount at the end of every month, the bill amount is entirely dependent on your usage. EC2 allows you to rent virtual computers. The provision of servers on AWS Cloud is one of the easiest ways in EC2. EC2 has resizable capacity. EC2 offers security, reliability, high performance, and cost-effective infrastructure so as to meet the demanding business needs.",

        "Kubernetes is a tool that helps us to run and manage applications in containers. It was developed by Google Lab in 2014, and it is also known as k8s. It is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, management, and scaling of container-based applications in different kinds of environments like physical, virtual, and cloud-native computing foundations. Containers are isolated from each other so that multiple containers can run on the same machine without interrupting anyone else. It allows us to deploy and manage container-based applications across a Kubernetes cluster of machines.",
